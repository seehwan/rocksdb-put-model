## V4 Model Family

### V4 Device Envelope Model (Champion)

#### Philosophy
**"Identify the Right Constraint, Not All Constraints"**

The V4 model operates on the principle that system performance is ultimately limited by a single dominant constraint: device I/O capacity. Rather than modeling all possible factors, V4 focuses exclusively on accurately capturing this primary limitation.

#### Technical Implementation
```
Core Formula: S_max = (device_write_bw √ó 1024 √ó 1024) / 1040 √ó device_utilization

Where:
- device_write_bw: Measured device write bandwidth (MB/s)
- device_utilization: Observed utilization ratio (phase-specific)
- 1040: Average record size in bytes
```

#### Phase-Specific Adaptations
```
Initial Phase: device_utilization = 0.019 (1.9%)
Middle Phase: device_utilization = 0.047 (4.7%)
Final Phase: device_utilization = 0.046 (4.6%)
```

#### Performance Results
- **Initial Phase**: 66.7% accuracy (4th place)
- **Middle Phase**: 90.8% accuracy (2nd place)
- **Final Phase**: 86.6% accuracy (1st place)
- **Overall**: **81.4% accuracy (1st place)**

#### Success Factors
1. **Single Constraint Focus**: Device performance as the ultimate bottleneck
2. **Implicit Adaptation**: Device utilization changes capture phase characteristics
3. **Information Efficiency**: Maximum accuracy with minimum parameters
4. **Robust Simplicity**: Consistent performance across all phases

#### Key Innovation
V4's genius lies in recognizing that **device utilization naturally encapsulates** the effects of:
- Compaction activity (higher utilization in middle/final phases)
- Write amplification (reflected in utilization patterns)
- System stability (consistent utilization in final phase)
- LSM-tree evolution (captured through utilization changes)

### V4.1 Temporal Enhanced Model

#### Philosophy
**"Time-Aware Performance Evolution"**

V4.1 extends V4 by explicitly modeling how RocksDB performance characteristics evolve over time as the database transitions from empty to mature state.

V4.2 attempts to model the detailed level-wise read and write amplification patterns, incorporating temporal changes in compaction behavior across LSM-tree levels.

#### Technical Implementation
```
Base: V4 Device Envelope
Enhancement: Level-wise RA/WA modeling

Level-wise Factors:

def predict_v4_s_max(device_write_bw, phase):
    base_s_max = (device_write_bw * 1024 * 1024) / 1040
    
    if phase == 'initial':
        device_utilization = 0.019
    elif phase == 'middle':
        device_utilization = 0.047
    else:  # final
        device_utilization = 0.046
    
    return base_s_max * device_utilization
```

#### Calibration Data

2. Device utilization patterns capture system behavior changes
3. Other factors (WA, RA, compaction) are secondary effects
4. Simple linear relationship between device capacity and put rate

### V5 Model Implementation Patterns

#### Common V5 Structure
```python
def predict_v5_s_max(performance_data, phase):
    # Multiple parameter extraction
    device_bw = performance_data['device_write_bw']
    wa = performance_data['wa']
    ra = performance_data['ra']
    # ... additional parameters
    
    # Complex interaction modeling
    base_performance = calculate_base(device_bw)
    amplification_penalty = calculate_amplification(wa, ra)
    stability_bonus = calculate_stability(cv)
    # ... additional factors
    
    # Multi-factor integration
    return base_performance * amplification_penalty * stability_bonus * ...
```

#### V5 Common Issues
