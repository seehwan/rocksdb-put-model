## Analysis Time
2025-09-19 11:39:40

## Overview
This report compares two different approaches to phase segmentation in RocksDB performance analysis:
1. **LOG-based segmentation**: Time-based 3-way split (32.2 hours each)
2. **Performance-based segmentation**: Performance-based 20%-60%-20% split

## Key Differences

### 1. Performance Scale
- **LOG-based**: MB/s units (10-300 MB/s)
- **Performance-based**: ops/sec units (10,000-300,000 ops/sec)
- **Difference**: LOG-based shows much lower values

### 2. Stability Pattern
- **LOG-based**: Initial instability → Middle stabilization → Final stability
- **Performance-based**: Consistently high variability
- **Difference**: LOG-based shows clearer stabilization pattern

### 3. Phase Characteristics

#### LOG-based Phases:
- **Initial**: Medium performance, Low stability
- **Middle**: Low performance, High stability
- **Final**: Low performance, High stability

#### Performance-based Phases:
- **Initial**: High performance, Medium stability
- **Middle**: Medium performance, Medium stability
- **Final**: Low performance, Medium stability

### 4. Segmentation Approach
- **LOG-based**: Time-based equal split (32.2 hours each)
- **Performance-based**: Performance-based 20%-60%-20% split
- **Difference**: LOG-based ensures time consistency, Performance-based focuses on performance changes

## Use Cases and Recommendations

### LOG-based Segmentation
- **Best for**: Analyzing internal RocksDB behavior
- **Advantages**: Time consistency, reflects actual system state
- **Use when**: Understanding system evolution over time

### Performance-based Segmentation
- **Best for**: User-facing performance analysis
- **Advantages**: Performance-focused, reflects user experience
- **Use when**: Optimizing for user performance

## Conclusion

Both segmentation methods provide valuable insights but serve different purposes:
- **LOG-based** is better for understanding system behavior and internal processes
- **Performance-based** is better for user experience and performance optimization
- The choice depends on the analysis goals and target audience
